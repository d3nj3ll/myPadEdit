DISCLAIMER!!!
=============
# using this on any server with outside access is VERY dangerous, 
because there is no password protection and anyone that finds the 
script can read and modify any of your files... i repeat: this is 
ONLY to be run on an iPad server. Furthermore, this is not a toy. 
If you do not know what you are doing, you can and probably will 
destroy your system. I am not sure how many ways there are to brick 
your iThing, but this is definitely one of them. BE CAREFUL!!! 
In the near future I will add a safe mode as default, but right now 
in this early stage (day3) that is not so important.

IT WORKS!!!
===========
It shouldn't come as a huge suprise, but it really works. And here
is a case in point: I discovered that the lighttpd.conf was not 
serving up svg files, but AMAZINGLY neither of my terminals wanted 
to let me edit and I accidentally :wq from a vim terminal editing 
the conf that had been contaminated with the wrong characters. 
Crud. BUT WAIT!!! I still had the server running, so it didn't care 
about its messed up conf because it had already been configured... 
So I used myPadEdit, navigated to /etc/lighttpd.conf fixed the file, 
saved it, restarted lighty from the command line and voila! The SVG's 
appeared and myPadEdit not only saved the day, but saved itself. I 
should be crying tears of joy - but instead I'll now add the 
__lighttpd.conf__ info here and let the games begin.

FAQ
===
* but why another text editor? because none of the free ones work for me.
* why on localhost? some things should still be private.
* is it faster? it lives on a lighttpd server running php - on your 
iThing, behind a firewall. so yes, its faster.
* is it against the law? no, jailbreaking is legal, stealing software 
is against the law.
* how do I install it? get your pad jailbroken, install a lighttpd 
server and php. make a conf file (listed below) clone this  with git 
into your /var/www folder and open http://localhost/myPadEdit/ in 
your browser.

#Release notes: (these refer to the base installation of PadEdit.)

##1.3

Security and general code quality improvements with amazing help from John Forte, Craig Smith, and Brett Terpstra.

Improvements to automatic quote, bracket, parentheses, and brace completion.
For security reasons, the minimum PHP version requirement was raised to 5.0.

On 2011 June 28, this version was moved into to GitHub.

##1.2

File pane is now fully collapsible. Just drag the resize handle all the way to the left. (Thanks, James!)

Fixed a bug where the PadEdit folder was sometimes visible in the file list.

Fixed some error messages w/r/t permissions.

Fixed a bug where a new folder or new file would be put in the wrong folder.

##1.1

Increases minimum permissions requirements to octal 755 (instead of 644).

##1.0

Initial release.


#Known issues:

Coda clips importing is still a little funky.
File permissions are more ... permissive ... than we'd prefer.

Text highlighting in Webkit-based desktop browsers is weird. Like this.

#To do:

Gesture-based shortcuts.

Snipplr.com integration.

Syntax coloring.

WYSIWYG editing.

Firefox support (probably doable around the time it supports SVG files as background images).

Opt-in (instead of opt-out, via %protect%) file editing.
